    # ============================= README =============================
    #    This is an *example function* demonstrating how to retrieve 
    #    all movies from the `MotionPicture` table and display them.
    #
    #    Retrieved data is passed to the `movies.html` template for rendering.
    #
    # Implementation Steps:
    #    - Open a database connection using the `Database` context manager.
    #    - Execute the SQL query to retrieve movie data.
    #    - Pass the retrieved list to `index.html` for rendering.

    #    - How `execute` handles SQL queries.
    #    - Why we pass `params` as a tuple (movie_id, user_email).
    #    - The role of `commit=True` in saving changes.
